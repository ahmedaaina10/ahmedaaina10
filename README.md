About Me:

I am Aleshba Aaina, a Final-year Computer Systems Engineering student at UET Peshawar from Mardan, Pakistan.
I am deeply interested in embedded hardware,artificial intelligence, and software systems, with a passion for architecting optimized hardware-software solutions and solving multidisciplinary challenges.

Skills:

· Programming: C, C++, Python, Assembly (x86/ARM), Verilog
· Embedded & IoT: Arduino, ESP32, FPGA (Xilinx), sensor integration, firmware development
· Systems & Debugging: Linux, GDB, Valgrind, memory management, multi-threaded systems
· Networking & Full-Stack: TCP/IP, Cisco Packet Tracer, Laravel, MySQL, VLAN/OSPF
· Tools & Methods: MATLAB, Git, Agile, PID control, DSP, AES encryption

Projects:

· FPGA-Based ATM System — Designed transaction logic with SHA256 encryption on Artix-7 FPGA, achieving 95% simulation accuracy.
· Smart Door Lock System — Integrated RFID, keypad, and biometric authentication using Arduino, eliminating unauthorized access.
· Voice-Controlled Robot — Built with ESP32 and CMUSphinx for noise-resistant voice commands with 92% accuracy and <50ms latency.
· Linux Memory Debugger — Fixed kernel-level memory leaks in drivers, improving system uptime by 40%.
· College LAN Simulation — Configured VLANs and OSPF routing for a 100-node network, reducing broadcast traffic by 60%.
